## Description

This machine learning model classifies a given mushroom into two groups (edible and poisonous) according to its features.

This model is trained on [mushroom classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/mushroom-classification). After trying multiple estimators, I decided to use the decision tree classifier given that its performance was excellent compared to the other alternatives (99% accuracy).

This project was made over a 4-day span in August 2022.
